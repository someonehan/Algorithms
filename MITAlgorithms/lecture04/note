1. divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
2. conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. if the subproblem size are small enough, however
   just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
3. combine the solution to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem
   (when the sub problem are large enough to solve recursively)
