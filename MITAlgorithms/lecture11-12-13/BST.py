this file is about binary search tree

the search tree structure supports many dynamic-set operations

1. how to walk a binary search tree to print its values in a sorted order
2. how to search a value in a binary search tree
3. how to find the minimum or maximum element
4. how to find the predecessor or successor of an element
5. how to insert into or delete from a binary search tree

# subtree of x are at least x.key. this means that the binary-search-tree-property
# Let x be a node in a binary search tree. if y is a node in the left subtree of x then y.key <= x.key
# if y is a node in the right subtree of x then x.key >= x.key

# we can represent such a tree by a linked data structure in which each node is an object
# in addition to a key and satellite data, each node contains left, right and p
